<h3>ABSTRACT</h3><br>

In today's digital age, cybersecurity threats are a major concern for individuals and
organizations alike. Understanding user susceptibility to these threats and their awareness of
how to protect themselves is crucial for mitigating risk. This project aims to assess user
susceptibility and awareness of cybersecurity threats through a combination of real time
surveys and experiments. By analysing the results, we hope to identify areas where users are
most at risk and develop strategies for increasing awareness and improving cybersecurity
practices. The findings from this project will be useful for individuals and organizations
looking to safeguard against cybersecurity threats and protect sensitive data. By understanding
user susceptibility and awareness of cybersecurity threats, we can work towards protecting
sensitive data and safeguarding against potential attacks. And also investigate the user’s
understanding of security measures and their willingness to take preventive action. The results
of this study will provide insight into the users’ attitudes towards cybersecurity and will be
useful for developing effective security education and awareness programs. This project is
going to test users with real time cyber awareness model which is configured with google
analytics to track every individual user activity and to give cyber awareness training based on
their levels<br><br>

The main goal of this project is to assess the user’s cyber awareness about real world cyber
threats and based on the evaluation result of individual user, cyber awareness training is given
to them.

<h3>Steps to Third Person Redeploy this cyber awareness Model:</h3>

➢ Host the website simulation in dedicated server or any hosting providers as your wise.
➢ Create a Google Analytics account and property for your website.<br>
➢ Create a Google Analytics tag in Google Tag Manager and create container in it with IP or
   Domain of the hosted website.<br>
➢ And next import the Tag configuration file to Google Tag Manger which is attached in
   source code zip file.<br>
➢ Now all configurations are imported to Tag manager. Final step to complete the setup
   is change the measurement ID with your Google Analytics Measurement ID.<br>
   
   
 
<h3>Steps to get measurement ID in google analytics:</h3><br>

➢ Sign into your Google Analytics account.<br>
➢ Under the "Account" column, select "Create Property."<br>
➢ Fill in the details for the property you wish to create, including the website name,
website URL, and industry category.<br>
➢ Select the data sharing settings that you prefer.<br>
➢ Click on the "Create" button to create the property.<br>
➢ Now Select the website property that created now to get the measurement ID for.<br>
➢ Click on "Admin" in the bottom left corner of the screen.<br>
➢ Under the "Property" column, click on "Data stream" and click on property name
snow.<br>
➢ The measurement ID will be listed. It will be a string of letters and numbers in the
format "UA-XXXXX-Y."<br>
